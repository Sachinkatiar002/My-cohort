A = CLIENT
B = SERVER

The flow:

(1) A -> B: Client sends username and passward

(2) B: Sesrver checks them against DB records and if they match it creates; first, signature using: baase54UrlEncode(header).base64Url(payload), #secret and then token using: signature.paayload.secret

(3) A <- B: Server sends back token to client 

(4) A <-B: client sends request to access certain URL with token in header

(5) B: Server decodes header and payload, uses #secret# to create another digital signature and compare it with what was sent in to ensure integrity
